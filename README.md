[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/85f8e5d9-e6fb-4179-ae21-03e4d731d74f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/iamshihab/deploys)

My personal website that loads faster than my coffee brews and contains more humor than my code comments. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because frameworks are overrated and I like to keep things simple.

Features include a profile section showcasing my role as a Technical Architect at Cefalo, interactive social links, and enough dad jokes to make any developer smile. The site is fully responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance.

Visit [iamshihab.dev](https://iamshihab.dev) to witness the magic (and questionable life choices). Perfect for when you need a break from debugging or just want to see what happens when a developer tries to be funny.
